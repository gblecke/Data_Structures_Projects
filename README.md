# Data_Structures_Projects
This is a collection of C++ projects I designed during a data structures and algorithms course at UA.

We constructed a few different data structures. We started with a circular array, continued on with a Treap, and finished the projects by designing a heap and a Fibonnaci heap. The final project implemented the two heaps in different ways. The Heap used a modified version of the CDA file from the first project. The Fibonnaci Heap was an entirely new constructed file.

The purpose of these projects were to design generic versions of these data structures so we could use them in future projects or courses. Each individual project was difficult, but highly rewarding. The course expanded my knowledge of C++ and gave lost of practice using and managing pointers. Pointers were a large point I struggled on during my first few computer science courses. After completing these projects, I gained a lot of skills in memory management and pointer management.
